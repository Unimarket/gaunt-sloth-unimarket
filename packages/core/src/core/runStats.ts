 * about it said "8 KB" — exact only for ASCII, and a different size from the one the code cut at
 * the moment a payload contained a character outside the ASCII range. Measuring UTF-8 bytes is what
 * those sentences already claimed, and it is the unit both neighbouring caps
 * (`builtInTools.<tool>.maxOutputBytes` / `maxBytes`) already use, so one number now means one size
 * to the person setting it and to the code applying it. An ASCII payload behaves exactly as it did
 * at this default; a non-ASCII one is cut somewhat earlier, which is the size the docs promised.
 *
 * This constant is the default's single source. A configured `toolResultCaptureMaxBytes` overrides
